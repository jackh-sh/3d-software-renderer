## About The Project

I wanted to learn C++ and CMake and I wanted to learn SDL, so I made this project. It's a simple app where a square floats around the screen. It's not very exciting, but it's a good starting point for anyone who wants to learn SDL.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

This project is written in C++.

To get a local copy up and running follow these simple steps. (MacOS arm64 only supported for now due to brew paths)

Install sdl:

```sh
$ brew install sdl2

Use make to build and run:

```sh
$ make
```
